## 🎓 ITI Graduation Project – Examination & Employment Analysis System

Welcome to our comprehensive BI project developed as part of the **ITI 4-month program**. This project simulates a real-world data analytics lifecycle — from understanding business requirements to building interactive dashboards and generating actionable insights for decision-makers.

---

## Project Overview

Our goal was to build an integrated system that allows stakeholders to analyze **student exam performance**, **certification status**, and **employment outcomes**. The project covers both the **back-end infrastructure** (databases, data warehouse, ETL) and **front-end reporting** (SSRS, Power BI).

---

##  Project Lifecycle

### 1️⃣ Business Understanding

* Started by **gathering business requirements** and defining **key questions** to answer through data.
* Built a full **Business Requirements Document (BRD)** to guide our development process.

---

### 2️⃣ Database Design & Development

* Designed a normalized **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**.
* Translated ERD into **relational tables** using mapping and normalization techniques.
* Created the full **database schema**, generated realistic data, and performed **data integration**.
* Documented all database entities, relationships, and assumptions.

---

### 3️⃣ Data Warehouse Modeling (EDW)

* Designed multiple **data marts** using **Star Schema** models tailored to specific business objectives.
* Built an **Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW)** using a **Galaxy Schema (Fact Constellation)** structure.
* Developed and implemented **ETL processes** to move data from OLTP to OLAP.

---

### 4️⃣ Reporting with SSRS

* Developed static and dynamic reports using **SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)** to provide operational insights on:

  * Exam results
  * Certification distribution
  * Student progress

---

### 5️⃣ Interactive Dashboards with Power BI

* Built a fully interactive **Power BI dashboard** that allows slicing and dicing of:

  * Student Exam Performance
  * Certification vs Employment Analysis
  * Track-wise and Intake-wise performance
  * Gender and Education-level comparisons
  * Instructor and Course evaluation

---

### 6️⃣ Final Presentation & Demo

* Presented the full project to **ITI supervisors**, showcasing the end-to-end solution.
* Demonstrated how data flows from raw tables to decision-driving insights.

---

##  Technologies Used

* **SQL Server** (Database & Data Warehouse)
* **SSIS** (ETL Development)
* **SSRS** (Reporting)
* **Power BI** (Interactive Dashboard)
* **Excel** (Data Validation)
